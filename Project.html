Together we've developed best practice resources for major events, to support the event sector in delivering a consistently high level of major event in New Zealand.

Our Resources section has:

planning advice
sample checklists
examples of plans and strategies
templates that can be adapted for different events
information about government event support and advisory services.
See Major Event Resources for all of these resources and more.

EventScotland
Our strategy includes developing partnerships with international event counterparts where there are common interests.

In 2012 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with EventScotland to improve the capability and enhance the reputation of both Scotland and New Zealand as international event destinations.
