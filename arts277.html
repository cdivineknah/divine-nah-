        <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my gramdparents first brought me to their new home in France and I have now been to twenty- nine different countries. Each has<br> given me a unique learning exprience. </p>
        <p>At five, I <a href="#">marveled</a> the Eiffel Tower in the city of Lights. When I was eight, Istood in the <br>heart of Piazza San Marco feeding horders of pigeons, then gilded down Venetian waterways<br> gonodolas. At thirteen, I saw the accident, megalithic sturcture of Stonehenge and along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stiones were still place just as it is in <a href="www.starzit.com">Starz University</a> </p>
        <p>It was through exploring culture around the world that I first became intresting in langunge.</p>
        <p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. but when I pronounce it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>
        <p>In the eighthgrade, I became Fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is beisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. this was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forgot how to say some thing in Spanish. <a href="contact@starzit.com">Send Us Email</a>. </p>
        <p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I love how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huo () meaning fire and Shan () meaning mountain can be joined to create Huoshan (), which means volcano. I love spendind hours at a time praticing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them. </p>
